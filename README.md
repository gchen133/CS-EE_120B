Embedded systems play a critical role in the design and implementation of practical real-world robotics and 
intelligent applications. The field of embedded systems focuses on how to develop fast, efficient, small, secure, 
reliable, and self-adaptive computing systems, covering both the hardware as well as the software aspects of the 
systems.
